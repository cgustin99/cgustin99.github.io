    <h1 class = "f">My Undergraduate Honors Thesis</h1>
      <p>My honors thesis for my Bachelor's degree in Physics was in computational quantum mechanics. My thesis focused on studying two algorithms, Variational Monte Carlo and the Eigensolver, to determine ground state energies of quantum potentials. My thesis, in its entirety, can be found here: </p>

    <h1 class = "f">Syracuse University Gravitational Wave Group</h1>
      <p>My first experience in research was in the Syracuse University Gravitational Wave Group. In this group, I spent time understanding PyCBC which is a python software package which explores sources of gravitational waves. The project below was what I worked on with my Syracuse University Undergraduate Reserach Grant: </p>

    <h1 class = "f">Computational Statistical Mechanics</h1>
    <p>In my junior year of my physics degree, I spent two semesters working on computational projects in the field of statistical mechanics. The two projects that I worked on were both using the Metropolis Algorithm in order to find ground state energies of systems. The two systems I modeled were the Ising model of the ferromagnet as well as phases of gases, liquids, and solids.</p>
