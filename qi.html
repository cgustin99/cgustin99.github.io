      <p>My current research is being done with Dr. Gary Goldstein in which we utilize a quantum computation optimization algorithm
         known as variational quantum eigensolver to found bound states of the Yukawa Hamiltonian of Quantum Field Theory. From here, we were the 
         first group to generate generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) via quantum computation. The GPD gives the momentum distribution 
         of partons in a hadronic bound state after an interaction, i.e., a pion interacting with a photon.</p>

      <p>In my final year of undergrad, I first learned about quantum computation/information and my passion was sparked. I did a project studying the Deustsch-Jozsa Algorithm which can be seen here:</p>
